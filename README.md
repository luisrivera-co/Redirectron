Redirectron
===========

#ATTENTION
This project uses a dependency with a known security flaw, but I am no longer developing it. Do not use this project in production. Just use the code for reference.

Redirectron is a web app that gives users a quick way to launch their Pythonista scripts on their iPhone/iPad.
Simply type the name of your script (case sensitive) into the text area of the first page and a page will be generated that can be bookmarked and added to the Home Screen.
Then everytime you tap the icon, the script will be lanched from Safari.
You can deploy your own using this code or just use mine here
